				  		<p>In my thesis I explore a some of the ways that after 9/11 the US government cultivated and perpetuated 
					  a national climate of fear and how that has lead zombies to huge popularity in America.
					  I believe one of the methods used to cultivate this national climate of fear was leaders and
					  legislators successfully changing the language used to talk about immigration. Before 9/11 the language
					  used to talk about immigration described an America open to diversity and inclusion. Post-9/11 the
					  language used to talk about immigration described an America needing to protect itself
					  from anyone trying to enter the country legally or illegally as a possible security threat.
					  <br><br>
					  With this project I wanted to explore a possible connection between 
					  key words recorded in the congressional record for specific years and the output of American zombie
					  films for those same years.
					  The key words I searched for are "immigration and safety" in any single recorded instance. 
					  I have searched 5 years pre 9/11 and 5 years post 9/11.  
					  <br><br>
					  Click the year buttons at the top of the page to find out how many instances of the key words 
					  were recorded for that year and how many American zombie films were released that same year.
